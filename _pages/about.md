Hi ! This is George (or Georgios or Giorgos).

I am a 3rd-year PhD candidate in Computer Science working at the [DaSciM](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) group of LIX, Ã‰cole polytechnique in Paris under the supervision of Prof. <b>Michalis Vazirgiannis</b>. 
On parallel, I work as a doctoral researcher in [Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home), Huawei Technologies France. 

Currently, I am working in the field of machine learning for structured data and, more specifically, in the graph representation learning. I am studying the expressive power of Message Passing Neural Networks or, as they usually called, Graph Neural Networks. Using the theoretical understanding of GNN architectures, my goal is to make impactful contributions in real-world problems that are characterized by an inherent graph structure. Such applications range from communication graphs to molecular networks.

Before my arrival in Paris, I graduated from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). My diploma thesis focused on deep learning for time series forecasting for predictive route optimization. The goal of the thesis was the application of the predictive optimization on real-time fuel-price prediction and route planning of cargo vehicles.
